# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Getting the AWS CLI working

We'll be using the AWS CLI often in this bootcamp, so we'll proceed to installing this account.

## Install AWS CLI

-  We are going to install the AWS CLI when our Gitpod enviroment lanuches.
-  - We are are going to set AWS CLI to use partial autoprompt mode to make it easier to debug CLI commands.
- The bash commands we are using are the same as the [AWS CLI Install Instructions]https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

Update our `.gitpod.yml` to include the following task.

```sh
tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
```

We'll also run these commands indivually to perform the install manually

### Create a new User and Generate AWS Credentials

- Go to [IAM Users Console] create a new user
- `Enable Billing console access` for the user
- Create a new `Admin` Group and apply `AdministratorAccess` and add the newly created user into this group.
- Create the user and go find and click into the user
- Click on `Security Credentials` and `Create Access Key`
- Choose AWS CLI Access
- Download the CSV with the credentials


### Set Env Vars

We will set these credentials for the current bash terminal
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1
```

We'll tell Gitpod to remember these credentials if we relaunch our workspaces
```
gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
gp env AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-south-1
```

### Check that the AWS CLI is working and you are the expected user

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see something like this:
```json
{
    "UserId": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Account": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:user/aws-account-name"
}
```

## Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget]
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html#examples)

Get your AWS Account ID
```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```sh
budget.json
-----------
{
    "BudgetLimit": {
        "Amount": "100",  
        "Unit": "USD"
    },
    "BudgetName": "Example Tag Budget",
    "BudgetType": "COST",
    "CostFilters": {
        "TagKeyValue": [
            "user:Key$value1",
            "user:Key$value2"
        ]
    },
    "CostTypes": {
        "IncludeCredit": true,
        "IncludeDiscount": true,
        "IncludeOtherSubscription": true,
        "IncludeRecurring": true,
        "IncludeRefund": true,
        "IncludeSubscription": true,
        "IncludeSupport": true,
        "IncludeTax": true,
        "IncludeUpfront": true,
        "UseBlended": false
    },
    "TimePeriod": {
        "Start": 1477958399,
        "End": 3706473600
    },
    "TimeUnit": "MONTHLY"
}

notifications-with-subscribers.json
-----------------------------------
[
    {
        "Notification": {
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN",
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL",
            "Threshold": 80,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"
        },
        "Subscribers": [
            {
                "Address": "example@example.com",
                "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

```sh
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

You can create an environment variable of your `ACCOUNTID` and pass it to the command

```sh
export ACCOUNTID = aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text

aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

## Creating a Billing Alarm

### Create SNS Topic
- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

We'll create a SNS Topic
```sh
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```
which will return a TopicARN, Copy this `arn` and save it.

We'll create a subscription supply the `TopicARN` and our `Email`.
```sh
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```
Check your email and confirm the subscription.

#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We can create the alarm configuration json file from this URL. (https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier 
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
Create an alarm configuration as a JSON file
--------------------------------------------
{
    "AlarmName": "DailyEstimatedCharges",
    "AlarmDescription": "This alarm would be triggered if the daily estimated charges exceeds 50$",
    "ActionsEnabled": true,
    "AlarmActions": [
        "arn:aws:sns:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT_ID>:<SNS_TOPIC_NAME>"
    ],
    "EvaluationPeriods": 1,
    "DatapointsToAlarm": 1,
    "Threshold": 50,
    "ComparisonOperator": "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold",
    "TreatMissingData": "breaching",
    "Metrics": [{
        "Id": "m1",
        "MetricStat": {
            "Metric": {
                "Namespace": "AWS/Billing",
                "MetricName": "EstimatedCharges",
                "Dimensions": [{
                    "Name": "Currency",
                    "Value": "USD"
                }]
            },
            "Period": 86400,
            "Stat": "Maximum"
        },
        "ReturnData": false
    },
    {
        "Id": "e1",
        "Expression": "IF(RATE(m1)>0,RATE(m1)*86400,0)",
        "Label": "DailyEstimatedCharges",
        "ReturnData": true
    }]
}
```

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```
